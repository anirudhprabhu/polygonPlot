## Here comes the Polygons Plot

In case you have not had enough plot and chart types, here come a new one: the polygons plot. The Polygons plot is designed to visualize multivariate ranges as opposite to single data points. I have developed the concept for the polygons plot in late 2018 while working on our review [Living at the Extremes: Extremophiles and the Limits of Life in a Planetary Context](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00780/full), published in 2019 in Frontiers in Microbiology. While working on the review, I started collecting data regarding the range (minimum and maximum) for physico-chemical parameters of Earth's life such as pH, temperature, salinity and pressure. I wanted to visualize the ranges of these variables in a single plot, but I could not find a simple way to do it. After some research and a lot of doodling, the polygons plot was born!
