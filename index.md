## Here comes the Polygons Plot

In case you have not had enough plot and chart types, here come a new one: the Polygon plot. A Polygon plot [_singular_, Polygons plot, _plural_] is designed to visualize multivariate ranges as opposite to single data points. I have developed the concept for the polygons plot in late 2018 while working on our review [Living at the Extremes: Extremophiles and the Limits of Life in a Planetary Context](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00780/full), published in 2019 in Frontiers in Microbiology. While working on the review, I started collecting data regarding the range (minimum and maximum) for physico-chemical parameters of Earth's life such as pH, temperature, salinity and pressure. I wanted to visualize the ranges of these variables in a single plot, but I could not find a simple way to do it. After some research and a lot of doodling, the polygons plot was born!

>The first polygons plot appeared in Merino et al. 2019 Frontiers in Microbiology. If you find the plot interesting or useful, consider citing the Merino et al. 2019 paper. More information about how to cite the Polygon plot are available at the section [how to cite](#how-to-cite)

We are working on a R package to be able to make Polygons plot easily and add some of the functionalities we have imagined discussing these plots with Shaunna Morrison, Fang Huang and Anirudh Prabhu. For now, we have a _beta_ Shiny app built by [Fang Huang](https://people.csiro.au/H/F/f-huang) than can be used right now to create Polygons plot and download them as **.png** or **.svg**. You can find the _beta_ of the app here: [fanghuang.shinyapps.io/DonatoPlot/](https://fanghuang.shinyapps.io/DonatoPlot/).

**A word of caution:** While it defines a space on a plane that can be used for algebraic operations to work on a series of plots (called a polygons plot array), it does not define the state space of the possible combinations of the visualized variables. Visualizing the polygon plot as the state space of possible instances might seem like an intuitive thing to do, but it is inherently **_wrong_**! You are have been warned!

>Fun fact! My friends refer to these plots as "Donato's plots"!
