A **Polygon plot** (singular, Polygons plot, plural) is designed to visualize multivariate ranges as opposite to single data points. The concept of `polygons plot` was developed by [Donato Giovannelli](https://www.donatogiovannelli.com/) in late 2018 while working on our review [Living at the Extremes: Extremophiles and the Limits of Life in a Planetary Context](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00780), published in 2019 in Frontiers in Microbiology.



A complete explanation of how polygon plot works can be found at

<summary>Story Details</summary>

While working on the review, he started collecting data regarding the range (minimum and maximum) for physico-chemical parameters of Earthâ€™s life such as pH, temperature, salinity and pressure. He wanted to visualize the ranges of these variables in a single plot, but I could not find a simple way to do it. After some research and a lot of doodling, the polygons plot was born!

## Installation

You can install the development version of polygonPlot from [GitHub](https://github.com/giovannellilab/polygonPlot) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("giovannellilab/polygonPlot")
```

## Example usage

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval=TRUE}
library(polygonPlot)

df <- read.csv(system.file(file.path("extdata", "example.csv"), package="polygonPlot"))
df
```

```{r plot, eval=TRUE}
plot <- polygonplot(df, shape = 4, fillcolor = "#57cc99", linecolor = "#38a3a5",
                    labels_axis = c("Earth", "Mercury", "Venus", "Mars"))
plot
```
